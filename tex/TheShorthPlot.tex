\begin{abstract}
We introduce the shorth plot for exploratory diagnostics of distributions. The shorth plot is a graphical representation of the length of the shorth, the shortest interval covering a certain fraction of the distribution. Localising the shorth, i.e. requiring it to contain specific data points, makes it usable for diagnostics.

The shorth can be defined as a functional which has an immediate empirical version. The empirical length of the shorth converges to the theoretical value with rate $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$.

\section{Distribution Diagnostics}
Exploratory diagnostics is one of the basic tasks in data analysis. Graphical displays are essential tools. If the task can be narrowed down, specialised displays may be available. For example, if there is a model distribution $F$ to be compared with, from a mathematical point of view the empirical distribution $F_n$ is a key instrument, and its graphical representations such as 
$PP$-plots $$x \mapsto \left(F \left(x\right),F_n \left(x \right) \right)$$ 
or $QQ$-plots $$\alpha \mapsto \left(F^{-1} \left(\alpha\right),F_n^{-1} \left(\alpha \right) \right)$$ are tools of first choice. If we consider  the overall scale and location, box \& whisker plot is a valuable tool. This tool loses its sharpness for large data sets, as the rules for identifying ``out'' and ``far out'' points seem to reflect data sizes which were typical at the time box \& whisker plots were introduced, but this is a detail which might be fixed. The main limitation is that  box \& whisker plots give a global view and ignore any local structure. In particular, they are not an appropriate tool if it comes to analyse the modality of a distribution. More specialised tools are needed in this case, such as the silhouette and the excess density plot, both tools introduced in \cite{dwmgs91jasa}.

Here we look for general purpose tools for the analysis of a distribution.
While we have some instruments for specific tasks, the situation is not satisfactory if it comes to general purpose tools. $PP$-plots and $QQ$-plots need considerable training to be used as diagnostic tools, as they do not highlight qualitative features. 

Focussing on the density, in contrast to the distribution function, leads to density estimators and their visual representations, such as histograms and kernel density plots. These however introduce another complexity, such as the choice of cut points or bandwidth choice. The qualitative features revealed or suggested by density estimation based methods may critically depend on bandwidth choice. Moreover, estimating density is a more specific task than understanding the shape of a density. Density estimation based methods are prone to pay for the initial smoothing steps in terms of slow convergence or large fluctuation, or disputable choices of smoothing.

We will use the length of the shorth to analyse the qualitative shape of a distribution. The shorth is the shortest interval containing half of a distribution. The length of the shorth is a functional which is easy to estimate, with convergence of rate $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, and gives a graphical representation which is easy to interpret. 

We will start with the classical definition of a shorth. To overcome the handicaps of other methods, we have to extend the classical definition to supply localisation, and to allow for multi scale analysis.

%
\section{The Length of the Shorth}
The shorth is the shortest interval containing half of a distribution. More general, the $\alpha$-shorth is the the shortest interval containing an $\alpha$ fraction of the distribution. The shorth was originally introduced in the Princeton robustness study as a candidate for a robust location estimator, using the mean of a shorth as an estimator for a mode \cite{ANDREWSD1972Robust-Estimati}. 

As a a location estimator, it performed poorly. The mean of a shorth as an estimator of
location has an asymptotic rate of only $n ^{-1/ 3}$,
with non-trivial limiting
distribution. 
\cite[p. 50]{ANDREWSD1972Robust-Estimati}  \cite[p. 767]{Shorack1986Empirical-proce}. Moreover, the shorth interval is not well defined, since there may be several competing intervals. 


However, as GrŸbel \cite{grbl88lshrt} has pointed out, the length of the shorth has a convergence rate of $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ with a Gaussian limit. The critical conditions are that the shorth interval is sufficiently pronounced (see \cite[section 3.3]{grbl88lshrt}).  Essentially this means that the shorth interval must not be in a flat part of the distribution. While the shorth position is not a good candidate as a location estimator, the length of the shorth qualifies as a reasonable candidate for scale estimation.

%:def: shorth
The length of the shorth is a functional which can be localised, thus providing a tool for local diagnostics.
We define:
\begin{dfn} The shorth length  at point $x$ for coverage level $\alpha$ is
$$
S_\alpha(x)=  \min \{|I|: I=[a,b],\  x \in I,\  P(I) \geq \alpha\}.
$$ 
\label{dfn:shrth}
\end{dfn}

We get the length of the shorth as originally defined by taking $\inf_{x}S_{0.5}(x)$.

The definition has a functional form which can be applied to theoretical as well as empirical distributions. The definition in terms of a theoretical probability $\prob{\noop}$ has an immediate empirical counterpart, the empirical length of the shorth
$$
S_{n, \alpha}(x)=  \min \{|I|: I=[a,b],\   x  \in I,\  P_n(I) \geq \alpha\}
$$ 
where  $\prob[n]{\noop}$ is the empirical distribution.

The get a picture of the optimisation problem behind the shorth length, we consider the bivariate function
$$
a,b \longmapsto I = [a,b] \longmapsto \big( \left| I \right|, P\left(I\right) \big)\qquad \text{where } a \leq b.
$$
This is defined in the half space $a \leq b$ above the diagonal. The level curves of $ \left| I \right|$ are deterministic parallels to the diagonal. The level curves of $P(I)$ depend on the distribution. The shorth at level $\alpha$ minimises $\left| I \right|$ in the area above the level curve at level 
$\alpha$, i.e. $\prob{I} \geq \alpha$. Going to the empirical version replaces the level curves of of $P(I)$ by those of  $P_n(I)$. 
The theoretical curves for the Gaussian distribution and for a  Gaussian sample are shown in figure \ref{fig:level}.
 Localising the shorth at a point $x$ restricts optimisation to the top left quadrant anchored at $a=b=x$.
 
\gsnote{paragraph added}The increasingly flat level curves for $P([a,b]) = const$  in figure \ref{fig:level} illustrate why the location of the shorth does not have satisfactory stattistical properties while the length of the shorth has good asymptotic behaviour.

\todo{align scales for plots where reasonable}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{TheShorthPlot-level}
\caption{The shorth length as an optimisation problem: minimize $| [a,b] |,$ 
under the restriction $P([a,b] ) \geq \alpha$. Localising at $x$ restricts the optimisation  to the quadrant top left of $x$ (shaded grey).}
\label{fig:level}
\end{figure}

\todo{inverse or dual?}
The inverse optimisation problem is to find the maximal coverage which can be achieved by a given length:
$$
\delta \longmapsto \sup  \{P(I): | I | \geq \delta \}
$$
%\delta \longmapsto \sup_{y}  \{P(I): | I | \geq \delta \}
together with its localised and/or empirical version.
%
The relation between the shorth length and its inverse is extensively used in Gr\"ubel's analysis of the asymptotics  of the (unlocalised) shorth. A modified version of Gr\"ubel's proof carries over to the localised shorth, provided there are no flat parts in the distribution, giving a  $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ asymptotics of the empirical shorth length to the theoretical shorth length.

\subsection{Elementary Properties}
Here and in the following, we assume a sample $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ from some distribution $P$ with 
distribution function $F$. Let $P_n$ be the empirical distribution and $F_n$ the empirical distribution 
function. The $k$-th order statistics is denoted by $X_{(k)}$.

\chck{ok?}\begin{rem}\emph{(invariance)}
For all $\alpha$
$$
x \mapsto S_\alpha(x)
$$
is invariant under shift transformations and equivariant under scale transformations, that is for $x^\prime 
= a  x+b$, for the transformed shorth length $S^\prime$ we have
$$
{S^\prime}_{\alpha}(x^\prime) = a  S_\alpha(x).
$$
\end{rem}
%
\begin{rem}\emph{(monotonicity)}\label{rem:monot}
For all $x$, 
$$
\alpha \mapsto S_\alpha(x)
$$
is monotonously non decreasing in $\alpha$.
\end{rem}
%
%: continuous F
%

If $F$ is continuous with  density $f$, additional properties are guaranteed:

\begin{rem}\emph{(minimising intervals)}
If $F$ is continuous, then for any $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ and any $x \in \real{}$, there is a (possibly infinite) 
interval $I$ such that $x \in I$, $\prob{I} = \alpha$ with $|I| = S_{\alpha}(x)$. \newline
If $\alpha < 1$, the interval is
finite and contained in $[x-S_{\alpha}(x), x+ S_{\alpha}(x)]$.
\end{rem}
\todo{add proof concl. 5}

\begin{rem}\emph{(continuity)}
For a continuous distribution function $F$,
$$
(x,\alpha) \mapsto S_\alpha(x)
$$
is continuous.
\end{rem}
%
\begin{rem}\emph{(strict monotonicity)}\label{rem:monotone}
For a continuous distribution function $F$, for each $x \in \real{}$,
$$
(x,\alpha) \mapsto S_\alpha(x)
$$
is strictly increasing in $\alpha$ on $(0, 1)$.
\end{rem}


In the limit,  $\lim_{\alpha \rightarrow 0} S_\alpha(x) =0$. 

In particular, for the empirical version, $S_{n, 
\alpha}(x) =0$ for $\alpha \leq \frac{1}{n}$.

%
%
\subsection{Computing the Empirical Shorth Length}
To use empirical distribution functions, the discontinuous case is of interest.

\begin{rem}\emph{(interpolation)}\label{rem:interpolation}
If $x_0 < x < x_1$ and $\prob{\ \left( x_0, x_1 \right)\  }=0$, then 
$$S_{\alpha}(x) = \big(S_{\alpha}\left(x_0\right) + \Delta_0\big) \wedge 
\big(S_{\alpha}\left(x_1\right) + \Delta_1\big),$$
where $x= x_0 + \Delta_0 = x_1 - \Delta_1$.
\end{rem}
%
\begin{rem}\emph{(algorithm)}\label{rem:algo}
For $\alpha, 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1,$ let 
$$\Delta_{\alpha} = \min\left\{k: \frac{k+1}{n} \geq \alpha\right\}.$$
Then
$$
S_{n,\alpha}(X_{i})= \min \{X_{(j+\Delta_{\alpha}} - X_{(j)} : \ 1 \leq j \leq i \leq j+\Delta_{\alpha} \leq n\}.
$$
Using a stepwise algorithm, a further reduction of complexity is possible: 
let 
$$\msc{C}_i \deq \{ I : X_{(i)} \in I, \prob{I} \geq	 \alpha\}$$
be the set of candidate intervals at $X_{(i)}$ for level $\alpha$. 
Then
$$S_{n,\alpha}(X_{i}) = \min\{|I|: I \in \msc{C}_i \}.$$
Unless boundary corrections apply, we have
$$\msc{C}_i = \msc{C}_{i-1} \setminus \{ [X_{(i-1-\Delta_{\alpha})}, X_{(i-1)}] \} 
\cup \{ [X_{(i)}, X_{(i+\Delta_{\alpha}})] \}.$$ 
This gives an algorithm with linear complexity in $n$.

\end{rem}

An additional reduction is possible using the monotonicity in $\alpha$ (remark \ref{rem:monotone}), but this may not be worth the effort.

\section{The Shorth Plot}
\begin{dfn}
The shorth plot is the graph of 
$$x \mapsto S_\alpha(x)$$
 for a selection of coverages $\alpha$.
\end{dfn}

The empirical shorth plot is $$x \mapsto S_{n,\alpha(x)}.$$ See figure \ref{fig:shorthdef}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{TheShorthPlot-shorthdef}
\caption{Theoretical shorth length and shorth length for a sample of 50 normal variates for $\alpha=0.5$. Note: different scales are used.}
\label{fig:shorthdef}
\end{figure}


Mass concentration now can be represented by the graph of $x \mapsto S_\alpha(x)$. A
small length of the shorth signals a large mass concentration. To make the interpretation easier, we 
prefer to invert the orientation of the axis so that it is aligned with density axis. This will be used in the subsequent figures.


\subsection{Display Details}
%
Several choices can to be made for the visual representation. 
The common conception seems to view a distribution represented by its density. From a mathematical 
point of view, plotting $x \mapsto 1/S_{\alpha}(x)$ would be first choice, since this is approximately 
proportional to the local average density.  This however is an infinitesimal approximation. It tends to overemphasise peaks (see figure \ref{fig:sinv}), and becomes useless for point masses. Using just a downward orientation for the y-axis 
avoids the need to special case point masses while keeping the qualitative impression.
\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{TheShorthPlot-sinv}
\caption{Shorth length (left) and 1/Shorth length (right) for a sample of 50 normal variates. The axis for the shorth is pointing downward. Note: different scales are used.}
\label{fig:sinv}
\end{figure}
%

To make comparison between different data sets easier, we can use the classical shorth length $\min_x S_{0.5}(x)$ as a scale estimator and remove the scale dependency by taking the quotient. This quotient
$$x \mapsto\  \ \frac{S_{\alpha}(x)}{\min_{x^\prime} S_{0.5}(x^\prime)}$$
is called the  standardised short length .
%for the (standardised) shorth plot. 
The only difference is the scale labeling.

%\end{figure}
In these notes, we do not use standardized shorth length, but use the original scales.


Instead of the exact interpolation
as in remark \ref{rem:interpolation}, we use a linear interpolation. The loss of information is negligible.
